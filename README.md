# [Chat Defender Drop-in](https://chatdefender.com/)
# OpenAI API Client Library in Swift

This is a drop-in replacement for the "OpenAI API Client Library in Swift", as maintained by Adam Rushy
https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift

It includes minimal changes to make it compatible with Chat Defender.

[Chat Defender](https://chatdefender.com/) allows you to use the same API, but without exposing your OpenAPI key or prompts.

It also allows you to modify your prompts on the fly.

## Installation üíª

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)

You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in the `Package.swift` file or by adding it directly within Xcode.

`.Package(url: "https://github.com/Chat-Defender/OpenAISwift.git", majorVersion: 1)`

## Usage ü§©

For the most part, follow the instructions in the original project
https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift

Read the documentation at Chat Defender to move your prompts & key to Chat Defender

You can then use the slightly modified API below

### [Chat](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)

Get responses to chat conversations through ChatGPT (aka GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 (in beta).

```swift
do {
    let chat: [ChatMessage] = [
            //'substitute_joke' is the key for a message with the prompt "Limit Prose: Please tell me a joke about ##subject##!"
            //'subject' is the subject for your new joke
            ChatMessage(role: .user,
                        cdContent: CDMessage(key: "substitute_joke",
                                             variables: ["subject" : subject])
                       )
    ]
                
    let result = try await openAI.sendChat(with: chat)
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```


### Endpoints

Initially only the chat endpoint is supported. 

I will be adding other endpoints rapidly.
